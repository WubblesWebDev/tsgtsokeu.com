beautiful day today. 

Youtube music just released my most listened to songs of the year and 95% of them are connected to men that i loved.

I sometimes forget that i broke up with Israel at the beginning of this year... and then fell in love with him again in the middle of summer.

and Then Andy reappearing in my life. Trying to process that.

this has nothing to do with Running, but its just thoughts i was having this morning.

i must have listened to Brazil by Declan McKenna about 100 times the week i broke up with Israel. its a good song.
