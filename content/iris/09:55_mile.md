BURRRR! today was even colder!

I had to wear some thick sweat pants instead of my leggings, which slowed me down, plus the wind was crazy strong

oh and after my run, I noticed a foul smell coming from near the enterance of the gate to my house. I thought it might be a skunk, but after I found the source, I realized one of our cats had been run over by a car and thrown into the ditch.

I dug a little grave for him (Zuko was his name) and said a little prayer. God rest his tiny animal soul.

I like to think that our animals are part of our family, even if they stay outside and I care for them in only the most basic way. But it means something that I would dig a hole in frozen ground in freezing wind, carry his decaying body all the way up a hill and then pray over him.

Goodbye Zuko. You will be missed.
