I took my phone with me this time and listened to music. I don't think it made me any faster, but it was nice.

Thankfully it wasn't nearly as cold today as it was yesterday, and the wind wasn't too bad either.

I tried using my running tracker app and it failed for some reason. it had my time, but it totally screwed up my miles, said I only did half a mile, when I know I did a full one. 

Back to Ye old stopwatch.
