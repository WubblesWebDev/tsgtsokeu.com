YAY!!! We made it back to being under 9 minutes!! EAT IT!

I think it was because I had been pushing myself in the freezing cold, so therefore I was in better shape to go for a run when it was actual decent weather (50 degrees!)

my method to not get too tired is to run against the wind to start off with and that way on my way back when I am tired as shit I don't have to fight the wind. It works pretty well.

Also I ran in the direction where I had to go uphill to start off with, and so I also had a downward stretch most of the way back.

## Life Lesson:

Take the blunt of the work to start off, when you are motivated, Don't push work off for whe you know you'll be tired.
