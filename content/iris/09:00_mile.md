one week of running a mile every day!

proud of me? I am. I'm proud of my results as well. Didnt know i had it in me still to be able to run under 10 minutes at all, but this week just prooved that hard work in the past never really gets wasted. I mean that by saying all that working out i did in the gym last year wasnt for nothing. 

i used to go on bike rides back in the year of 2019. thats what originally got me excited about getting in shape. that year was really the year i too charge of my health and decided i wasnt satisfied being the way i was. ever since then ive been on a steady incline towards healthier lifestyles and choices. 2019 was also the year i wanted to start to learn new things. i started taking Russian classes online (though those never went anywhere, lol. still want to learn it though) and it was also the first time men started paying attention to me. 2019 was the year Israel came up to me and engaged me for the first time...

hard work isnt for nothing.
