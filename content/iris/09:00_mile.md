One week of running a mile every day!

Proud of me? I am. I'm proud of my results as well. Didn't know i had it in me still to be able to run under 10 minutes at all, but this week just proved that hard work in the past never really gets wasted. I mean that by saying all that working out i did in the gym last year wasn't for nothing. 

I used to go on bike rides back in the year of 2019. thats what originally got me excited about getting in shape. that year was really the year i took charge of my health and decided i wasn't satisfied being the way i was. I believe it was triggered by looking down in the shower and saying "this makes me extremely unhappy."

Ever since then I've been on a steady incline towards healthier lifestyles and choices. 2019 was also the year i wanted to start to learn new things. I started taking Russian classes online (though those never went anywhere, lol. still want to learn it though) and it was also the first time men started paying attention to me. 2019 was the year Israel came up to me and engaged me for the first time...

Good choices aren't good enough. True accomplishment comes from good, long lasting, lifestyle choices.
