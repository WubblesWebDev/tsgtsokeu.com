## As part of our recovery, I am talking notes from those with serious addiction problems and trying to follow some of the same protocol. Some people go to AA, I go to MA (translate that however you'd like). I would love if I could keep these meetings private, but I think there is something theraputic about putting things on the internet so anyone could see. 
Plus I have somewhat backed myself into a corner by saying there would be no hidden pages on this site, so I have to have it somewhere where people could find it, and not just for people that are looking for secret pages.
obviously anyone that inspected my github repo would be able to find out there is a page that doesn't display, but how often does someone scan over other's repos of their websites? sounds like a great waste of time.

this isn't the first time i've written one of these, it's actually the fourth. I do them whenever I am having an extra hard time with coping with my life. luckily I have 6 friends that are all in the same situation as me.

`M` is Maven

|| Meeting in session ||
|:--|---|--:|
|`Iris` so I have a little stupid problem. I was writing the new error code for lilac's page, just to be funny... And then something dawned on me.|| |
| || |
| || `Daisy` What's that, Iris? |
| || |
|`Iris` So correct me if I am wrong, but I remember the translation for that code being the meaning behind 404, not 403. 404 means site not found. 403 is Forbidden Access.|| |
| || |
| || `Daisy` I am not following. |
| || |
|`Yara` yeah, I dont't see a huge difference in those two error codes, what are you talking about?|| |
| || |
|`Iris` Didn't things back then feel weird?? Remember he way that message was folded in the envelope?? How when I asked what it meant, he didn't tell me right off the bat, and it wasn't until I was about to leave that day that he couldn't help but tell me the meaning behind the note?|| |
| || |
|`Yara` yes, we can all admit that things back then were weird, your point?|| |
| || |
|`Iris` HE TOLD US THAT IT MEANT NOT FOUND!!! which is basically like saying "hey, in your fantasy world that you're in right not, it'll never happen. I don't feel that way towards you, plus all the other stuff" but that's not what he said. He said "forbidden access, you may not enter here" which basically translates to "hey, these feelings, they exist, but it's forbidden because of all the other stuff."|| |
| || |
| || `Sunny` you are definitely over thinking this, man. |
| || |
|`Iris` It meant even all they way back then, in freaking july there was something going on. I used to deny it, but now I see how fucked this whole situation was from the start...|| |
| || |
| || `Lil` I remember that note... I wish I had it. I think he might have casted it into a list and used **.join**, but I thought there was something to do with string slicing where he just stepped over the the 3rd pos, but I tried that and I couldn't get it to work. |
| || |
|`Iris` are you being serious!? you are concerning yourself with what kind of method he used to make the message?|| |
| || |
| || `Lil` well what do you want me to talk about? huh! I remember how awkward it was! fucking shit, I could barely go home afterwards and had to go to sonic with R to cool off and talk to her about it... |
| || |
| || `Lil` She asked me the same question he asked me. |
| || |
|`Iris` it was Dangerous all the way back then.. not even three weeks into work.|| |
| || |
| || `Lil` I should have left back then. I was unequipped to deal with him. We all were. |
| || |
|`Iris` and now he heeps trying to use python requests to hack in? what the hell is he doing?|| |
| || |
| || `Sunny` Don't forget the Chess.com friend request! |
| || |
|`Iris` Yeah! God, I told A about that (not that A, stupid) and she was livid... when I said "guess who sent me a friend request today?" she was like "really?" and I said "yeah. and I denied him." and she said "oh, I wonder why after all this time he finally did it now"|| |
| || |
|`Iris` appearently she thought I was talking about the guy from Wewoka, when I said "you know I am talking about ~~M~~ right?" she said "WHat? Fucking ~~M~~, Fuck off."|| |
| || |
| || `Lil` I used to think that A (not that A) didn't like him because she just didn't like the way he took me away from her, but the truth is... He changed, and I got in the middle of it. |
| || |
| || `Lil` I told her that I didn't know what happened to me, that I don't know what happened to my morals to get to the point where I got. She said "bad company corrupts morals." |
| || |
|`Iris` I wish this all had a good ending. I really do, but I don't believe I deserve a happy ending.|| |
| || |
| || `Lil` A is right. I am corrupted. I've been corrupted. in an attempt to find where I belong, I ended up getting lost, belonging nowhere. |
| || |
|`Yara` all hope is not lost. We can't just give up on trying to make life happy because we don't deserve it. that's stupid! tons of people in this world get what they don't deserve. it's called grace!|| |
| || |
|`Yara` everyone deserves grace, including ~~M~~. and you forget that we knew he was struggling with things from the beginning? you remember the dreams? of us walking out to the car and seeing th pile of drugs sitting in the backseat with him past out in the back? he had a problem, and he traded it off to another kind of addiction. Us.|| |
| || |
| || `Lil` that's... really fucking sad. |
| || |
|`Yara` We thought we could help, but eventually things get out of control. There is a reason why we can never get into psychology. We get too attached to people with problems and can never truly say goodbye.|| |
| || |
|`Yara` Don't forget all the good he's done either. We can't get over the whole situation with hate, that just won't happen. we have to recognize our own needs. I need to feel like I didn't lose a friend for nothing, that I was just completely duped into a fucked up situation for nothing. No! we fucking learned so much shit from this entire thing, not only about about work, but life, love, what  makes us happy, how to do things for ourselves.|| |
| || |
|`Yara` I am tired of pretending to everyone that the 4 months were entirely bad, that I should feel like shit for letting it all happen, or for letting myself get menipulated by some crazed man. FUCKING BULL! We were given a shit sandwich, a fucked up situation and tried for a really long time to make things work.|| |
| || |
|`Yara` Remember the maps we made? The ones with two directions? chaos and shalom? Remember how many times we encouraged him to talk to her? that has to count for something, even if it didn't amount to anything... like burying a dead cat in freezing wind. it means something, even if no one is there to appreciate it.|| |
| || |
|`Yara` life has meaning, we are defined by our past, but just as much, we are defined by our present and future. Don't let it be for nothing...|| |
| || |
| || `M` :) |
| || |
|`Yara` cheer up. Life has meaning, life has purpose, life has definition that stretches far beyond our insites.. life is past, present, and future. || |
