| || `Kid` I have problems. I have a lot of problems. |
| `Iris` We know. || |
| || `Kid` We need to find balance again. |
| || `Yara` He wasn't the dangerous one. |
| || `M` We were. |
| `Daisy` no more checking top... it isn't healthy. || |
| `Lil` I know... || |
| || `M` or checking my namesake. |
| `Daisy` Esspacially there. || |
| `Lil` I know... || |
| || `Sunny` Stop it, guys. we can't keep doing this to ourselves. Do we need to reduce our time on here? yes! god, we aren't getting things done like we should, But cutting off everything is a sure fire way to take a trip down to depressionvill. |
| `Lil` our relationship with ~A is perhaps damaged beyond repair. We barely talk. and whenever I open up to her about anything important (like telling her that I am still heartbroken, and that I am still checking his activity) she doesn't even act surprised. I get a lot of judgement from her, and now my relationship has become telling her things that I do wrong and her not being surprised... Maybe if I give up checking top I will get be able to build something back with her. || |
| `Lil` I accidently sent ~~M~~ a request on chess.com. I was looking up his name and I hit the friend request button on accident. || |
| `Lil` I cancelled it as soon as I could, I fear it went through. || |
| `Lil` I think about him all the time... Happy memories are turning into Scary ones. What once were dreams are now nightmares. || |
| || `Yara` I want to share so much with him. if I had five minutes with him I think I would just talk about quines and coding and how excited I am for the future... Even if he isn't a part of it. |
| || `Yara` My other meeting didn't make that clear. I don't think he is crazy. I think he is Amazing. |
| || `Yara` I still think highly of ~~M~~. Every time someone says something poorly of him, I have to hold myself from telling them all the good he did for me. Instead I just nod along like I agree. It feels like a total betrayal. He has been only one person that gave me a chance in life, that really believed in me. |
| || `Yara` I can't stand that there is a part of us that hates him... Iris being that someone. I fear she might drag more down that path. Lilac is turning too... Every day I see her cutting herself off. I sometimes forget that the original aspect of lilac was she needs someone to take care of... But she can't take care of herself. |
| || `Yara` Lilac is trying to come to terms that she will never see him again. We all are. |
| `Lil` I live in a fantasy land to cope. I make up stories and situations where everything is fine. I like to think about gaining superpowers to telapathically communicate with him. One of my favorite movies growing up was called [In Your Eyes](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2101569/) where one day this woman and this man just suddenly gain the ability to see things through the others eyes and hear through others ears, feel what they feel. They didn't know eachother, they had no connection what so ever. I think she lived in Maine and he lived in New Mexico. He was an ex con that worked at a car wash, making nothing of his life, and she was an uphappily married woman who had been hospitalized several times for mental illness. in the end they ran away together, literally hopping on a train and running away. It was really corny, but I loved that movie. || |
| `Lil` that is where I use most of my mornings. that's why I wake up so early. it's easier to make up stories like that when I am in a half dream state. || |
| `Daisy` We need to use mornings for a more practical use. like praying. || |
| `Lil` I pray. I do pray. I pray every morning. || |
| `Lil` but I am growing bitter. || |
| `Lil` I am growing bitter towards myself. || |
| `Lil` This has become an outlet... I pray that it doesn't become more then that. I am still worried that the actions i made in the past will happen again, that I will lose control like before. I have to keep questioning myself, questioning if I am a good person... || |
| `Lil` I made a lot of mistakes. Perhaps if I (Lilac) wasn't involved none of this would have happened. If I hadn't been so lonely, so desperate for attention and approval... || |
| `Lil` I want to be stable again. I want to feel like I have control over my life. || |
| `Daisy` I am making the decision to stop checking the access logs on here. || |
| `Daisy` we are going to stop checking activity for a week. think of it as a fast. || |
| `Lil` what about me? || |
| || `Yara` you get to keep writting in here. I think that would be healthy. We had been ignoring these meetings for awhile.  |
| || `M` I am sorry, M.... I feel like I failed you, I feel like I didn't do anything right towards you, even though you tried to give me everything. |
| || `M` I'm not going to kill you in my mind. Even if I could, I wouldn't. You deserve better then that.  I miss it, I miss you. Know that even though I am not cyber stalking you anymore, I am still thinking of you all the time... I'm sorry that I couldn't be better for you... I'm sorry for evetything that I did to your family. |
