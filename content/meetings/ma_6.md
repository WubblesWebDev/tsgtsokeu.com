today mom and dad were with us. They talked about mistakes in their past romances. It was nice to hear I wasn't the only one that made mistakes.

||Meeting||
|:--|---|--:|
| || `M` so today was really rough. Am I right guys? |
| || `Sunny` I feel great! lol |
| `Daisy` that's because we were't coped up all day to ourselves. we actually went out and did things with people. What Maven is talking about is all those memories from listening to that YTMusic playlist this morning, realizing how much we had lost this year, not only ~~M~~, but also Israel and Andy. || |
| `Lil` We really had a shitting year for love. || |
| || `Sunny` Lol, no kidding. |
| || `M` But it ended on a good note! Instead of doing this meeting all on our own, we had others with us. I am of course referring to my parents. They sat down with me and I got to tell them how really unwell I've been doing today, about the playlist that reminded me of love lost, about some of the Happy memories I had, and how much I missed ~~M~~, explained to them the meaning of scarecrow, How I felt yesterday after I had written that post about Hugo... |
| `Daisy` Dad said he was really impressed with how far I've come within the last couple of months in terms of programming, and that my goals of being a highly competent programmer was well in my current trajectory. || |
| `Daisy` He also said that he had some of the same goals when he was younger like me, that He had high ambitions, that he wanted to be competent in all his interests, and that it can be a weight sometimes that is too hard to bare. He said that's partly what caused him to get into drug use. It was an escape from pressure he put himself under. || |
| `Lil` I also talked to them about the way I still felt towards ~~M~~, that I know it'll never happen, but my dad encouraged me to use an AA method to deal with thoughts and doubts about where it would go if I ever let my guard down. He called it Play That Tape to The End. || |
| || `Yara` the meaning behind it is that you need to play things all the way out in your mind. Allow yourself to go down that fantasy, but don't just play the beginning of the fantasy, play the fantasy all the way to the end. It never ends well. Ever. |
| `Daisy` and if it does end well, check your answers. there are solid truths behind this problem, and you can't equate your fantasy to reality if you don't play with the same laws and rules. || |
| `Lil` Lately all my dreams and fantasies don't add anywhere towards reality. Sometimes it's worse then reality. || |
| || `Yara` you could be experiencing separation from reality all together. Lil, Are you okay? |
| `Lil` I feel like they'll never be a reality where I will ever really be satisfied, a place where all my cups will be filled, so I try just to construct them in my mind. || |
| || `Yara` God, that sounds extremely unhealthy. |
| `Lil` I was tried of coming up with no answers. || |
| || `Sunny` you know, lil. not all the variables are in yet? we are only 21 and the majority of life is still ahead of us! |
| `Lil` Then why does it feel like life has already ended... || |
| `Iris` it's because of ~~M~~. He is the one that did this to her, he's the one that let it go too far.  He was supposed to be the one that didn't fall asleep. || |
| || `Yara` it isn't his fault entirely. It's both of ours. |
| || `M` we can't blame him just because it makes it easier on us. It's unfair to the parties that can't defend themselves. |
| || `Yara` plus hating someone is a great way to become a person absorbed by bitterness.  |
