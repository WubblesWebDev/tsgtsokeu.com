Well I have finally done it, lol. ![Standing Desk](/standingDesk.jpg)

I've bee wanting a standing desk since I saw my boss use his. Sure, its fun to just sit on the couch wth a laptop and relax, but for the majority of the time, that can get, well... Lazy! 

also one of the worsts things you can do with your back is sit down. in order of best to worse for your back it goes,

- |+ + Walking/Running
- |+ Standing
- | Laying on your side in fetal position 
- |- laying flat on your back with tons of pillows
- |- - Sitting in a chair at a desk 

This summer while I was at my internship, I was sitting at a desk for about 5 to 7 hours a day. My back would feel so stressed at night that it hurt to lay down flat. I was hunched over a keyboard and mouse so much. I felt like all my muscles were tied up in knots.

Ever since I saw my old mentor use his standing desk, I've wanted one. I thought it was a great way to stay healthy while still working an "office" job. 

I literally just set it up like this, so I don't know how much I will keep it up, but I like it for the, um... 10 minutes it's been like this, lol. I'll also have to keep an eye out and make sure I don't put anything under my desk. Appearently its a big thing for people who get standing desks to start putting things under them.

ALSO! I learned that my keyboard I got as a bonus for my internship has different settings. you can scroll through them by holding down the FN key and pressing the Insert, Home, Page Up, Del, End, or Page Down keys. I think there is like 20 settings in total, maybe 25. It aint just rainbows! also you can turn the brightness and timing with the FN and arrow keys. Pretty cool! anyone with a REDRAGON keyboard, check it out. fun way to spend 5 minutes out of your day.

## End Note:

Still not gonna check my access logs. Hopefully the hackers that are using Python_requests to get in don't ruin anything, but there isn't really anything of value on here. This site got spammed like crazy when I first ran it around the 3rd. They thought it was a WP site so they tried to get in with /wp-shop-login/ and of the such.

Right now I don't have any sensitive info on here like passwords or user information (lol, I don't even have any users) so we are all good. Eventually, if I start building sites for a living, I'll take some cyber security classes so I'll know how to deal with them.
