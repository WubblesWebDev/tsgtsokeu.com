Pictures from the topeka zoo trip last night.

Nothing much to say except it was kind of fun to get out and joke around with a group of friends. Wish these trips weren't so expensive though. seems like every time I go out I am spending 45 to 50 dollars. I went to go see a movie with Annaka last week and the tickets were freaking 19 dollars a piece! also I paid for gas which racked up a nice bill of 75 dollars.

It's far easier on my wallet to just stay home and be depressed, lol.

## End Note:

I was so tired last night I went straight to bed as soon as we got home. Usually I will straighten up before bed, but was too tired. I jumped out of bed this morning to shut off my alarm and forgot that I had the chess set sitting on my floor. 

If you thought stepping on a Lego piece was bad, try **JUMPING** from 4 feet off the ground onto a solid wooden chess set. 

My foot got checkmated.
