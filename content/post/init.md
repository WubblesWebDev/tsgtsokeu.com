I finally got git to start working!!

I'm not even sure how I figured things out, but eventually things just started making sense. After enough time of banging your head against a keyboard, reading articles online, and some trial and error in the terminal, it just clicks.

That's the way things work for me. I just have to keep banging my head again a keyboard and eventually it makes sense, lol.

On my journey of figuring out how computers work under the covers, I am starting to figure out how I learn things and how **I** work under the covers.

All in due time... All in due time. I feel like I making porgress in my efforts, even if they are slow.

Just keep Pushing!

## End Note:

I have added some of my stats from running to Iris, and a new recipe to Daisy.

Keep an eye out, I may start uploading other posts on there. I made a pretty cool breakfast this morning, but I don't want it to show up on my main blog posts, so recipes go on Daisy, stats go on Iris.
