First time I've gone for a run in awhile. I really wish I would do it more often because I always feel better when I'm done.

I used to be a pretty dedicated runner. Around this time last year I was running a 5k (3.1 miles) once a week and going for at least a mile run every time I went to the gym, which was three to four times a week. My best time ever was a 8:35 mile.

I had a system of reliance for my life of monotony. I used to sit in a booth all day and run a register for a car wash. I filled my time with reading books, crocheting, watching political commentary, or YouTube videos of large verity.

To feel like I wasn't going no where in life I convinced myself to do some kind of self improvement, which took the form of physical exercise.

I used to eat really healthy as well. I either had oatmeal (the kind with no sugar) or a green protein shake every morning after my workout, then have a lunch of baby carrots and hummus. 

I ended up getting into probably the best shape of my life. 

Then I lost my job...

I went through a kind of pre-life crisis, because I realized I didn't have really anything in terms of skills or education. I only knew how to run a register and clean a house, which I definitely didn't want to do for the rest of my life. so I decided to start focusing on something that interested me deeply. Computer science and web design. 

I didn't realize what a difficult tasks learning all that on my own would be. In my mind I was expending so much energy into improving myself mentally, I didn't have the motivation to do both study all day and also do any kind of exercise or eat healthy.

There has been a couple exceptions throughout the months since I lost my job in May of this year, but for the most part I've been on a steady rate of decline in terms of muscle. 

Although I haven't gained any weight, I don't have any of the strength or definition I used to have, which really bothers me. 

For the past month I've been battling extreme depression. To help myself stay sane I know I should get back onto a regular workout schedule and to eat healthier.

So here is my accountability. I'll make a post about it! Proclaiming it to the world!!

I still look good in my workout leggings, so that's something.

Tucker decided to go on the run with me. He's a good running mate!

And that was my final time for a whole mile...

Not as good as I would hope it would be, but we all have to start somewhere. 

I'm going to try to keep track of my progress throughout the week, going for a run every day. I'll post those times on Iris when I get around to it.

## End Note:

I'm currently trying to focus on school instead of the website, so what you see right now in terms of design is what you get for awhile. As much fun as it is to figure things out, I am noticing what a time eater it is. 

Last week I spent about 75 percent of my effort on getting this thing working, so I deserve a break. Just short updates and posts for now.
