Have you ever played chess before? this is a game of mine from September 29th while I was at camp. I was playing a friend of mine's husband and it was only our second game together. The game was intense and definitely one of my proudest I've ever played. I felt like when I was playing it my brain was on fire. every move seemed to bring me to a better position on the board.

But that was not from lack of effort from the other side of the board. My opponent, (call him X) was far smarter then I. X went to college for electrical engineering and had just given a presentation that day about God's existent that was highly engaging and impressive to everyone that attended. X was someone I respect for his intellectual abilities. coming to this point on the board was a great confidence boost to my chess journey. it was the first time I beat someone by making almost all perfect moves and all the right decisions.

You may notice that it isn't actually checkmate in the image. when I was playing I had the forethought to take a picture right before checkmate because I feel like they are far prettier to look at. I think my exact words to X were "I am going to take a photo to see if there is any way to get out of this." X didn't find this very funny.

By far one of my best games to date. I almost wish I had it on Chess.com so I could analyze it and replay it over again, see what the computer thinks of my chess skills, but there is something about playing a game in person when you can look at the person your playing thinking over their moves. I prefer the in real life version.

Something I would define about Iris is that she love winning, and loves even more to feel smart. That's what chess is to her. Proof that maybe we aren't so dumb after all.

## End Note:

I've done some analysis and the only good move for X to make at that moment is pawn to F4. Its the only one that gives any kind of possibility of winning. either way: Black needs to put White in check or White wins next move no matter what.
