That’s right, you heard me! I spent literally all day pounding my head against a keyboard trying desperately to figure out how the hell to get Hugo and DreamHost to play nice. It’s really fucking stupid how easy it really was in the end, but god... the things I learned along the way!!

Right now I have installed Hugo (the actual program) on the server so I can literally post from wherever so long as I have a terminal window open in front of me. This installation of Hugo was completely unnecessary, but! I now I have this powerful ability, I might as well use it, right? 

I made designed this website about a week ago, but the battle to get it hosted really came to a head today.

I am now well versed in the ways of the terminal command like rm, mv and vi. Also how to use Hugo to create markdowns (.md) with just a commands. When I finally got the public dir to display on the website, I shouted for joy! I figured something out all on my own! I could have stopped so many times today but I persevered through it all. DAISY FOR THE WIN!!

So yeah, now I am making a post directly from my phone because I realized I could get a ssh terminal running on my phone! I’m not even using a browser to update my website! I’ve gone full blown watchdogs_ up in this bitch!

This is what it looks like. Pretty neat. The program I’m using also has a sftp fine which I can use to open and edit my markdowns and add new photos.

## End Note:

Moral of the story? Don’t give up. Keep pushing through it.

But the duality of that is take breaks, otherwise you get burnt out.
