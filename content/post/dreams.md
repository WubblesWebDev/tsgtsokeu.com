This morning I had a really hard time... I ended up staying in bed until 9am. Normally I am up and out of bed around 7:30 and I have my alarm set for 6:30 (spending an hour in the morning to meditate or to finishing any dreams that I was in the middle of), but this morning I literally couldn't pull myself out of bed.

This has happened to me before, and it's never a good sign... I think I am slipping again. I am really happy I'm still dedicated to running once a day, because it gives me something that I **NEED** to get done. Also I am sticking really strong to the pomodoro techinque today, I know I need to take the breaks. (I am actually writing this on one of my breaks)

So what had me stuck in bed this morning? I had a dream that was kind of inbetween a dream and a day dream... And it ended up taking a really dark turn, so much so I was shaking afterwards.

For the last couple of years I have been having these visions of myself being pregnant, but being alone. The idea of raising a child by myself is really scared. This morning my dream was centered around a scenario like that, and I realized just how alone I would be...

I don't think thats how reality would turn out, but the dream felt realistic. When I woke up I was clutching my stomach as if there was something in there.

So yeah, funny how Fantasy can have an affect on Reality. I am still kind of recovering from it. I shouldn't allow myself to stay in bed for too long otherwise my imagination starts to take on a mind of it's own. 

Sunny made me a playlist to make me feel better. You can find that on Her page (which is on the pulldown menu, or [/sunflower/](https://tsgtsokeu.com/sunflower/))

Sunny always wants us bottom tier aspects to feel better, but that isn't always a great idea because she is a bit crazy and reckless, get us into all kinds of trouble, but in this case it was innocent... Thanks for the Music, Sunny. I espacially like the first and fourth songs in the playlist. I listened to it on my run this morning and they are great.

#### This is the first time I've made a post from my aspect of lilac, and I don't know how I feel about it... But I hate that I have to keep her burried in my mind. This is an outlet, and the only outlet I am going to give her. She'll find someone... eventually.
